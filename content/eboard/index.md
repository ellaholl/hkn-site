## Mo Ghafoor (President)

## Korina Pluss (Vice President)

Hello! My name is Korina, and I am a rising 4th year in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I previously worked at Pluralsight as a full-stack software developer co-op! I am also on the board for Northeastern's Cheese Club, and I love being able to stay in touch with other student leaders through HKN.

## Julia Estrin (Secretary)

Hi Everyone! I'm Julia and I am a a rising fourth year electrical and computer engineering student. I have been in HKN since the spring semester of my sophomore year. My first co-op was at Desktop Metal in Burlington, MA and my second is at SpaceX at their testing facility in Texas. I love the opportunities HKN has provided to me, such as attending the Student Leadership conference at Tufts University this past fall.

## Liz Woodwell (Treasurer)

Hi! Iâ€™m Liz and I am the treasurer for HKN this year. I am a 4th year working towards my bachelors in computer engineering and masters in engineering management. Currently, I am co-oping at Ten Percent Happier as a QA Software Engineer. My co-op prior was at Acacia Communications on the DSP team. I am looking forward to getting more involved with HKN this year and getting to better know fellow ECE students.
